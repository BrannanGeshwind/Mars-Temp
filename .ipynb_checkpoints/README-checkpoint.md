Repo for Module 11 challenge

## Updates
8/30 -Finished Part 2 of challenge. Credit to Ashley and Rebekah for guidance on using value_counts in code for Martian months via Slack, and to Christopher for guidance with scraping the table to a Data Frame.
     -Analysis for Data included at the end of the notebook, will also be pasted in a section down below.
8/29 -Got to Section 3 of Part 2.
     -Completed Part 1 of challenge. Updated README to reflect languages/libraries used.


8/27 -Created repo and added files to local drive.

## Analysis
Based on the information obtained from the analysis, the coldest month is the third month, coming in at -83.307292. On the other hand, the eigth month is the warmest at -68.382979. This data was recorded over 1867 days.
Pressure wise, the sixth month has the lowest pressure at around 745.054422, whereas the highest pressure month is the ninth, coming in at 913.305970. Based on the final graph, subtracting two roughly estimated peaks (815 - 125), I would say that an average Martian year is 690 days long. Per NASA, via Google: "Mars is a little slower, and farther from the sun, so a full circuit takes 687 Earth days â€“ or one Mars year."
